      <p>Hello everyone! We're super excited to announce that Crystal Caverns is going into an <strong>open beta!</strong> Here's just a few things you'll be able to experience:</p>
      <h1>Survival like never before</h1>
      <p>Try out a fresh survival, which feels like modded Minecraft but is actually purely vanilla, including hundreds of new biomes, plenty of insane dungeons, unlimited amounts of powerful weapons and much, much more!</p>
      <img src="../assets/blog/biome-showcase.webp" alt="Autumn Taiga">
      <h1>Dungeon Runs</h1>
      <p>We will also have an early version of our brand new take on Dungeons, called <strong>Dungeon Run!</strong> In this mode, you're placed into a dark, scary dungeon, where you have a limited time to gather as many resources as possible in a short time limit, and try not to die to the powerful undead that live in those catacombs! High risk, but even higher reward!</p>
      <img src="../assets/blog/dungeon-run.webp" alt="Dungeon Run sneak peek">
      <h1>Customizations Galore</h1>
      <p>There's also going to be plenty of customisability, including memorable weapons, armor and of course, plenty of cosmetics to customize your character profile or earn loveable companions, with many more options to come!</p>
      <img src="../assets/blog/structure.webp" alt="Survival Dungeons Showcase">
      <p>There's so much more to Crystal Caverns than what I've written here, but to experience Crystal Caverns, you have to play it yourself! Join us on the <strong>1st of December 2023 @ 18:00 CET</strong> for the grand opening!</p>
      <h1>Future Plans</h1>
      <p>And as a cherry on top, the next half a year of Crystal Caverns will be packed with updates, which we will soon share in our upcoming <strong>roadmap</strong>, so stay tuned and join our <a href="https://discord.crystalcaverns.net">Discord</a> to stay up to date! Thanks for reading everyone, and we hope you are as excited for Crystal Caverns as we are! 🎉💜</p>
